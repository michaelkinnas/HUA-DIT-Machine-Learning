# Contains all the files for the semester exercises for the course "Machine Learning & Applications" of Harokopio University of Athens

## Exercise 1
Contains a Python implementation of a linear regression model and comparisson with an lr model from `sklearn`

## Exercise 2
Contains implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks with `PyTorch`. They are trained on a dermatology dataset to detect and classify skin abnormalities.

## Exercise 3
Contains an implementation of a GPT2 light model from `PyTorch` to explore it's functionality.
